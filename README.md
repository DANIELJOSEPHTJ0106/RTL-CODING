# RTL-CODING
This repository contains my RTL design and simulation projects written in Verilog HDL. The focus is on implementing fundamental digital logic circuits and more complex systems using Register Transfer Level (RTL) modeling techniques. Each module is structured with clear documentation, testbenches, and simulation results.
