# RTL-CODING
# 🔧 RTL Design using Verilog HDL | Xilinx Vivado

This repository contains a complete Verilog HDL project developed using **Xilinx Vivado**. The design was synthesized, implemented, and successfully used to generate a bitstream file for FPGA deployment.
---
We followed a step-by-step RTL design methodology, covering the full development cycle:

1. ✅ Verilog HDL RTL Coding  
2. 🧪 Functional Simulation (Behavioral Level)  
3. 🛠️ Synthesis using Xilinx Vivado  
4. 🧩 Implementation (Placement & Routing)  
5. ⚙️ Bitstream Generation (.bit file) for FPGA Programming
